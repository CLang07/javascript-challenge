# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

In the UFO-level-1 folder running the index.html file will display the UFO data in the data.js file.  The table shows `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.  The index.html file uses the app.js file to display the data.  The app.js file displays all the data when the index.html is run and can be filtered to a specific date/time using the button.  

In UFO-level-2 the file structure is the same.  The only difference is there are additional filters for `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.  These filters can be used inclusively or exclusively by using the 'and' or 'or' buttons.
